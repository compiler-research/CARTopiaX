# CARTopiaX

This repository provides an **agent-based simulation** of tumour-derived organoids and their interaction with **CAR T-cell therapy**.  
Developed as part of Google Summer of Code 2025, the project is released under the **Apache License 2.0**.

The simulation integrates computational modeling and biological insights to explore tumour–immune dynamics and assess treatment outcomes under various scenarios.

## Project Overview

This project implements an **agent-based model** to simulate the behavior of *tumour-derived organoids* (lab-grown tumour models) and their response to **CAR T-cell therapy**.

With this simulation, researchers can:
- Recreate in vitro conditions for tumour growth.
- Introduce CAR T-cells and analyze their effectiveness in solid tumor microenvironments.
- Explore different treatment strategies and parameter variations.
- Evaluate outcomes such as tumour reduction, elimination, or relapse risk.

By adjusting biological and therapeutic parameters, the model enables **in silico experimentation** to complement laboratory research.

## Dependencies

- [BioDynaMo](https://biodynamo.org/) (tested with version 1.05.132)
- CMake ≥ 3.13
- GCC or Clang with C++17 support
- GoogleTest (for unit testing)

**Note:** Ensure BioDynaMo is installed and sourced before running the simulation.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/compiler-research/CARTopiaX.git
cd CARTopiaX
```

---

## Building the Simulation

**Option 1:**  
Use BioDynaMo’s build system:
```bash
biodynamo build
```

**Option 2:**  
Manual build:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j <number_of_processes>
```

---

## Running the Simulation

After building, run the simulation using one of the following methods:

**Option 1:**  
With BioDynaMo:
```bash
biodynamo run
```

**Option 2:**  
Directly from the build directory:
```bash
./build/CARTopiaX
```
